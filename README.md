# AttachmentManager
Work related project

A simple VSTO add-in for Outlook

Save all attachments (and optionally email body, in HTML format) to shared drive folder
with consistent folder naming, through use of a form that allows user to enter crime or
incident number. Add-in then generates the folder and saves the files.

Does not require user to manually create and name folder, so avoiding issues with inconsistent
folder naming.

Default root folder is saved in user settings file, but can be changed by user later.
